## What is QOS

It's a simply operating system developed by QZero.

The development is based on the MIT 6.828 Labs ([JOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/)), which I've just finished it, you can find my solutions in this [repo](https://github.com/QZero233/MIT6.828).

## Blogs

I'll keep writing blogs to record what I think is valuable.

Here is the link to the [blog collections page](https://blog.csdn.net/powerful_green/category_12588763.html).

## Future Plans

- ✔️Migrate the tool chain to Windows (It will be more convenient for me since I will not need to code in a VM any more ^_^)
- thinking......
